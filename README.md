Amazon Returns Risk Prediction

Project Overview

This repository contains the work done as part of the Final Project Bootcamp Rakamin. The objective of the project is to assist Amazon, a global e-commerce leader, in effectively managing the product return process. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to predict the risk of product returns, enabling Amazon to take proactive measures and enhance operational efficiency.

Dataset

The project uses the Amazon Sales Dataset, which includes data related to transactions, shipping, and other logistical information. The dataset was explored and preprocessed to derive meaningful insights and build a predictive model.

Project Objectives

Build a predictive model to detect products at high risk of being returned.

Enable Amazon to implement preventative measures based on prediction results.

Improve customer experience and logistical efficiency by reducing return rates.

Methodology

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Analyzed dataset to understand patterns and distributions.

Cleaned data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights.

2. Model Development

Utilized XGBoost as the primary machine learning model for its robustness in handling complex datasets.

Achieved an initial recall of 83%.

Improved recall to 95% after hyperparameter tuning, ensuring high accuracy in detecting return risks.

3. Feature Importance

The following features were found to be the most influential in predicting return risks:

Shipping Regions: West and South regions had higher risks.

Product Categories: Items like ethnic clothing and lower-body apparel showed higher return tendencies.

Weekend Deliveries: Packages delivered on weekends were more likely to be returned.

4. Business Process Integration

The machine learning implementation in e-commerce follows these steps:

A customer places an order, and the system processes payment and records the transaction.

The seller receives a notification to ship the product, and the system notifies the customer.

The machine learning model predicts the shipping status and return risk based on various factors.

If the return risk is high, the system notifies the seller and contacts the customer to take proactive steps, such as providing clarifications, changing the shipping method, or offering discounts.

Preventive measures like additional discounts, insurance, or optimized shipping methods are applied to minimize the return risk before proceeding with delivery.

Results

The predictive system reduced potential return rates by 15%.

The model’s insights supported strategic decision-making in logistics and customer service.

Key Takeaways

Machine learning can effectively address real-world business problems in e-commerce.

The project highlights the importance of collaboration, detailed data analysis, and leveraging technology to drive impactful solutions.
